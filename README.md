# SECTION-F-Advanced-Interview-Level-Challenges
## SECTION F: Advanced / Interview-Level Challenges
This section focuses on advanced SQL queries that simulate
interview-level and real-world analytical challenges.
The queries require a strong understanding of JOINs, subqueries,
aggregations, grouping logic, and date-based analysis.

These problems are designed to test analytical thinking, not just
SQL syntax, making them ideal for technical interviews and real-world
data analysis scenarios.

📌 Queries Covered
1️⃣ For each customer, show their latest order date (include customers with no orders)

Displays the most recent order date for every customer, including those
who have never placed an order.

Concepts used:

LEFT JOIN

Aggregate function (MAX)

Handling missing data

Customer-level analysis

2️⃣ For each category, find the top-selling product

Identifies the best-performing product within each category based on
sales quantity.

Concepts used:

Multi-table JOINs

Aggregations (SUM)

Group-level ranking

Advanced grouping logic

3️⃣ Find customers who bought products from at least two different categories

Identifies customers with diverse purchasing behavior, indicating
cross-category engagement.

Concepts used:

DISTINCT counts

Multi-table JOINs

GROUP BY and HAVING

Behavioral analysis

4️⃣ Identify repeat customers with more than one order

Finds customers who have placed multiple orders, useful for identifying
loyal or returning customers.

Concepts used:

Aggregation with COUNT

Customer-wise grouping

Repeat behavior analysis

5️⃣ Generate monthly revenue trend

Analyzes revenue trends over time by grouping sales data month-wise,
helpful for identifying growth patterns and seasonal trends.

Concepts used:

Date functions

Time-based grouping

Revenue aggregation

Trend analysis

This project was independently designed, developed, and implemented by me as part of hands-on SQL learning and practice.

All database schemas, queries, logic, and analysis were created and written by me to demonstrate practical understanding of SQL concepts including JOINs, aggregations, and data analysis.
